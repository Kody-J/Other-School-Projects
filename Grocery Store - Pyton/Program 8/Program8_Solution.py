## CS 101
## PROGRAM 7
## 
## 
## CREATIONDATE: 03-07 MAY 2017
## 
##
##  PROBLEM:
##          GIVEN A SKELITON PROGRAM AND USING UNIT TESTING, CREATE A PROGRAM
##          WHICH OPENS A FILE CONTAINING CUSTOMERS AND SIMULATES A GROCERY
##          STORE. CUSOMERS WILL CHOOSE A 1 OF FOUR LANES TO GO THROUGHT BASED
##          ON THEIR LINES, WHILE CASHIERS CHECK CUSTOMES ITEMS, UNTILL NO MORE
##          CUSTOMERS ARE LEFT.
##
##  ALGORITHM:
##              C1: Create a class which will simulate a Customer
##	C1.1: Each customer will have these attributes:
##		C1.a: Customer Number
##		C1.b: Arrival time
##		C1.c: Number of Items in basket
##		C1.d: Number of Items purchased (payed)
##		C1.e: Exit Line Time
##		C1.f: When the Cahier Arrived 
##		C1.g: When the Cashier Exited
##
##      C1.2: Create a Method which will print out each Customer details
##	    C1.2a: Each customer Instance should be in the Format C (1) 
##
##      C1.3: Create a Method which sets an arrival time to each Customer instance when they get
##            into a Line (time will be tracked in “tick”s; whole number increments starting from 0)
##
##	C1.4: Create a Method which can be called when the Customer gets to the cashier:
##		C1.4.1: Sets the line_exit attribute
##		C1.4.2: Sets the cashier_arrival_attribute
##		
##	C1.5: Create a Method for when the Customer exits the Cashier:
##		C1.5.1: Takes in the time “tick” when the customer got to the Cashier
##		C1.5.2: Sets the cashier_exit attribute
##
##	C1.6: Create a method which Updates the Clock:
##		C1.6.1: If the customer has arrived at the Cashier:
##          C1.6.1a: Number of payed Items increases, and number of Items decreases per clock tick
##          C1.6.1b: If the number of Items left is < 1:
##	    C1.6.1b.a: The Customers is finished checking out
##	
##      C1.7: Create a Method which tracks the “Wait Time”
##	 	C1.7.1: Subtract the arrival tick(n) time form the exit tick(n) time:
##			C1.7.1a: Assign that value back to that customer Instance
##
##      C2: Create a class for the Cashier:
##	    C2.1: Each Cashier will have these attributes:
##		C2.1a: Lane (will reflect the unique lane up to 4 for each customer line)
##		C2.1b: Line (reflects the number of Customers in the Lane queue
##              C2.1c: Exit_Pool (reflects the number of Customers finished purchasing Items in a single Lane)
##
##	C2.2: Create a Method which will print out a string representation of the Cashier 
##		C2.2a: It should be in the form Checker $ (1) 
##		C2.2.b: If the Cashier has a customer:
##			C2.2ba: Format should look like Checker $ (1) – C (1)
##	C2.3: Create a Method which updates the Cashier Instance:
##		C2.3a: If the Cashier has a Customer:
##			C2.3a1: Each time tick Increases the Customers “Purchased “items by 1
##			And decreases the “Items” by 1:
##		C2.3b: If the Cashier has a Customer and the Customers “Items” < 1:
##			C2.3b1: Customer leaves Line and enter the Exit_Pool
##			C2.2b2: If there is another Customer in the Cashier Line queue:
##				C2.2b2a: Customer moves to the Cashier
##		C2.3c: If the is no Customer:
##			C2.3c1: We get one from the Line queue if there is one
##	
##      C2.4: Create a Method for is_empty:
##	C2.4a: If there are no Customers with a Cashier or in the Cahiers Line:
##		C2.4a1: Returns a True bool
##
##      F1: Create a function which reads in the “arrivals” .txt file
##	F1.2: Open file and append contents into a list for further user
##	F1.3: Close the File
##
##      F2: Create a Function which will act as a clock:
##	F2.1: The Clock will only use Integers starting form tick (1)
